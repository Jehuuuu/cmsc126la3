1. This happens in step by step, when both algorithms are done and the user prompts to change from step by step to auto, it should automatically reset all visualization in the grid (the blue and yellow path)
2. The border for each algorithm should be solid, in that way whenever the user prompts to switch the algorithm the left algorithm would lose the color on its border
3. step by step, whenever both algorithms have reached the final path it should prompt a toast to show and disables the next step.
4. Whenever we drag the start or even the end, it should be superior drag and should remove anything on its way from walls to weighted nodes. As of this iteration only the walls can be removed when we drag the start/end the weighted nodes will still exist even if we dragged our start/end over  it.
5. Help modal should be centered and above the viewport, we should also widen it.
